-   [**Descriptor “Implementation”**](#descriptor-implementation)
    -   [*26. I sometimes struggle to distinguish between “observed”
        versus “potential” costs. For example, I read the following “We
        estimate hogweed prevalence at circa 0.1 hectare per district.
        Given 323 rural districts, yields an expectation of 0.323 km2
        inhabited by hogweed, whose removal would cost over € 5.6
        million. However, these control efforts are not being
        undertaken, it must be further assumed that less than 10 % of
        this infested area is being dealt with (author’s estimate).”
        Then later in the text these € 5.6 million listed as “annual
        costs incurred by giant hogweed infestation in Germany.” The
        authors classify it as an incurred –&gt; observed cost, despite
        previously mentioning that only 10% of this estimated amount is
        actually being spent. I have classified it as “potential”
        although I still have doubts because the estimate is based on
        the species’ current distribution. What do you
        say?*](#26-i-sometimes-struggle-to-distinguish-between-observed-versus-potential-costs-for-example-i-read-the-following-we-estimate-hogweed-prevalence-at-circa-01-hectare-per-district-given-323-rural-districts-yields-an-expectation-of-0323-km2-inhabited-by-hogweed-whose-removal-would-cost-over--56-million-however-these-control-efforts-are-not-being-undertaken-it-must-be-further-assumed-that-less-than-10--of-this-infested-area-is-being-dealt-with-authors-estimate-then-later-in-the-text-these--56-million-listed-as-annual-costs-incurred-by-giant-hogweed-infestation-in-germany-the-authors-classify-it-as-an-incurred--observed-cost-despite-previously-mentioning-that-only-10-of-this-estimated-amount-is-actually-being-spent-i-have-classified-it-as-potential-although-i-still-have-doubts-because-the-estimate-is-based-on-the-species-current-distribution-what-do-you-say)
-   [**Descriptor
    “Acquisition\_method”**](#descriptor-acquisition_method)
    -   [*27. You mention that “extrapolation” relies on computational
        modeling. Is it always the case? For example, if it’s a simple
        area-based upscaling without any modeling involved, would it be
        estimation or
        extrapolation?*](#27-you-mention-that-extrapolation-relies-on-computational-modeling-is-it-always-the-case-for-example-if-its-a-simple-area-based-upscaling-without-any-modeling-involved-would-it-be-estimation-or-extrapolation)
-   [**Descriptor “Impacted\_sector”**](#descriptor-impacted_sector)
    -   [*28. Where the costs are for eradication, what is the
        appropriate “impacted sector”? Is it the sector where most of
        the costs of the invader would be if it weren’t eradicated, or
        should it be authority/stakeholder costs because they are the
        ones paying for the
        eradication?*](#28-where-the-costs-are-for-eradication-what-is-the-appropriate-impacted-sector-is-it-the-sector-where-most-of-the-costs-of-the-invader-would-be-if-it-werent-eradicated-or-should-it-be-authoritystakeholder-costs-because-they-are-the-ones-paying-for-the-eradication)

    -   [*29. The paper on economic impact of Acacia in Israel actually
        reports the annual mean willingness to pay (WTP) for containment
        or eradication of A. saligna was US USD8.41 and US USD8.83,
        respectively. This is a non-monetary method. So I guess we
        should not include it in
        Invacost?*](#29-the-paper-on-economic-impact-of-acacia-in-israel-actually-reports-the-annual-mean-willingness-to-pay-wtp-for-containment-or-eradication-of-a-saligna-was-us-usd841-and-us-usd883-respectively-this-is-a-non-monetary-method-so-i-guess-we-should-not-include-it-in-invacost)
    -   [*30. In some papers, they report that control/eradication
        investment contributed to certain economic value that was saved
        (e.g. ecosystem services, agriculture production, etc.) -
        something that would be destroyed by IAS if such control effort
        was not implemented (e.g. “It has been estimated that if sea
        lamprey was not controlled, the loss of fishing opportunities
        and indirect economic impacts could be greater than USD500
        million annually”). I was also including such costs as
        “Extrapolation”/“Potential” costs - on one hand, that is
        something that did not happen and won’t it happen, because there
        was control effort and such loss was prevented, but on the other
        hand that is a nice indication of the potential of IAS to cause
        economic cost, so it seemed appropriate to enter such economic
        benefits saved/prevented through control as estimates of
        potential damage some species can produce. What do you
        think?*](#30-in-some-papers-they-report-that-controleradication-investment-contributed-to-certain-economic-value-that-was-saved-eg-ecosystem-services-agriculture-production-etc---something-that-would-be-destroyed-by-ias-if-such-control-effort-was-not-implemented-eg-it-has-been-estimated-that-if-sea-lamprey-was-not-controlled-the-loss-of-fishing-opportunities-and-indirect-economic-impacts-could-be-greater-than-usd500-million-annually-i-was-also-including-such-costs-as-extrapolationpotential-costs---on-one-hand-that-is-something-that-did-not-happen-and-wont-it-happen-because-there-was-control-effort-and-such-loss-was-prevented-but-on-the-other-hand-that-is-a-nice-indication-of-the-potential-of-ias-to-cause-economic-cost-so-it-seemed-appropriate-to-enter-such-economic-benefits-savedprevented-through-control-as-estimates-of-potential-damage-some-species-can-produce-what-do-you-think)
    -   [*31. I have two papers which report avoided damage costs using
        cost-benefit analyses. I interpret these as benefit values, and
        if I understand correctly we do not include those in Invacost? I
        have included excerpts from the paper here below. What is your
        advice?*](#31-i-have-two-papers-which-report-avoided-damage-costs-using-cost-benefit-analyses-i-interpret-these-as-benefit-values-and-if-i-understand-correctly-we-do-not-include-those-in-invacost-i-have-included-excerpts-from-the-paper-here-below-what-is-your-advice)

    -   [*33. I am not sure if the criteria I was applying for this
        column is a proper one. If the authors of a grey report did some
        estimation/calculation/extrapolation themselves, or cited others
        who did it, but in either case if they did not explain clearly
        how they came up with the value (in a clear enough manner so
        others could repeat the whole procedure) I was marking it as
        “Low”, as being a non-repeatable value. Moreover, if they
        reported some investment (e.g. cost of eradication in some area)
        but didn’t provide clear data about it (e.g. who funded it, who
        and what was exactly funded, etc.), e.g. if they only cited
        briefly some other paper as a source, I was also marking it as
        “Low”, as being non-repeatable - I am not sure if this is
        OK?*](#33-i-am-not-sure-if-the-criteria-i-was-applying-for-this-column-is-a-proper-one-if-the-authors-of-a-grey-report-did-some-estimationcalculationextrapolation-themselves-or-cited-others-who-did-it-but-in-either-case-if-they-did-not-explain-clearly-how-they-came-up-with-the-value-in-a-clear-enough-manner-so-others-could-repeat-the-whole-procedure-i-was-marking-it-as-low-as-being-a-non-repeatable-value-moreover-if-they-reported-some-investment-eg-cost-of-eradication-in-some-area-but-didnt-provide-clear-data-about-it-eg-who-funded-it-who-and-what-was-exactly-funded-etc-eg-if-they-only-cited-briefly-some-other-paper-as-a-source-i-was-also-marking-it-as-low-as-being-non-repeatable---i-am-not-sure-if-this-is-ok)

    -   [*36. There are some studies which have modelled the cost of
        managing (or containing) invasive species in a landscape. Like
        other modelling studies, these studies often use known
        parameters based on a small spatial scale to extrapolate the
        estimated cost for a larger spatio-temporal scale. While dealing

        only if the authors also reported that the given IAS also
        produces some positive monetary values, and they reported such
        values in the paper? There is also a case where authors report
        cost of controlling/eradicating some species, and they also
        provide some positive values that such control efforts produce
        (e.g. increased employment), but I think this should not be

This page lists the most common questions asked on the InvaCost
database, and the answers we provided for them. If you have one question
which is not addressed here or in the database descriptor paper, please
contact us by email or open an issue in this GitHub page.

# **General questions on InvaCost**

## Where can I access the database and all related materials?

The database and all associated files (including complete definition and
details of each descriptor, the template you should use to provide
correction or integration of cost data, and the summary of all changes
made between the successive versions of the database) are freely
available and downloadable at
<https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12668570>.

## Which cost estimates should I use for my analyses?

There are several fields that contain economic values (they generally
contain the word *cost* in their names), but you probably don’t need
most of them. Indeed, we stored original cost information from the
papers (**Raw\_cost\_estimate\_local\_currency** column) and
standardised them in 2017 US USD using two different methods based on
either **exchange rate (ER)** or **purchasing power parity (PPP)**.
However, this raw information is often difficult to compare because of
different periods of time during which those costs have occurred (e.g. 1
year vs 10 years). Therefore, we standardised all cost estimates on an
annual basis. We recommend you use one of these two standardised cost
columns:  
- **Cost\_estimate\_per\_year\_2017\_USD\_exchange\_rate**: cost
estimate per year expressed in USD 2017 based on **ER**  
- **Cost\_estimate\_per\_year\_2017\_USD\_PPP**: cost estimate per year
expressed in USD 2017 based on \*\* PPP**.  
While the second standardisation based on **PPP\*\* is probably more
robust to provide relevant estimations/comparisons between countries,
basic official information on **PPP** is still lacking for most
countries and/or years. Therefore, **PPP**-based standardization could
not be performed for several cost entries in the database. Therefore, we
generally tend to focus on data from the
**Cost\_estimate\_per\_year\_2017\_USD\_exchange\_rate** column to avoid
working with too limited data.

## Should I pay attention to specific cost information in order to build my dataset prior to analyses?

InvaCost is the most up-to-date and comprehensive compilation of both
published and grey literature on the economic costs of biological
invasions. Therefore, it includes sound estimations of realized economic
costs of invasive species, with detailed sources and reproducible
methodology; but it also includes non-observed, unsourced and/or
irreproducible estimates. Therefore, we recommend focusing on those cost
data that are *observed* (**Implementation** column) and of *high*
reliability (**Method\_reliability** column). Nonetheless, depending on
your objectives you may want to consider potential costs that are of
*high* reliability. Overall, you should first define your objectives and
then filter out the cost data from the database.

## Do I have a risk to encounter duplicates and/or overlaps for some cost entries?

While we do our best to limit/exclude exact cost duplicates, InvaCost
may have cost entries that could be actual or potential duplicates, or
overlaps that may be (i) *temporal*: recent cost entries that
incorporate older ones; (ii) *geographic*: cost entries that cover a
large spatial scale, and that may include some costs provided at smaller
scales; (iii) *taxonomic*: cost entries covering several species that
may include several costs also provided separately for single species
(e.g., ‘Rodentia’ order with ‘diverse/unspecified’ species, while there
are other costs for *Rattus* spp.*and *Mus\* spp. in the same area);
(iv) *methodological*: same cost entries provided as different ones by
(at least two) different studies. We have a descriptor (**Overlap**
column) indicating these overlapping costs. Nonetheless, any user should
be aware of – and then acknowledge – this potential limitation, and thus
perform specific data processing prior any analyses. Indeed, following
the objectives of a particular study, there may be different options to
deal with these duplicates, including for instance 1/ working at
specific spatial scales below (and including) the *country* level to
avoid double counting in some *continental* or *regional* costs (while
this strategy could not be suitable for species with few costs provided
for those spatial scales that would be removed), or 2/ identifying for
each species (through a table) cost data that are recorded in the same
geographic region/country with the same cost values.

## How can we correct and/or expand cost information in the database, and then use these novel data for our analyses?

We are willing to receive any feedback that could improve our database.
Any reader or user can therefore add new information and/or correct
existing ones within InvaCost using our dedicated template (see
**Question \#1**). The contributors are expected to send a message
(along with the template filled with corrected and/or new cost entries)
to our e-mail address: <updates@invacost.fr>. Contributors should
provide access to the document from which information was taken.
Similarly, we are willing to receive any idea or suggestion to improve
the structure of InvaCost through the same email address. As you may
see, the structure of the database has substantially evolved since its
first release. When you use your corrected dataset, you should simply
state clearly and transparently in your article/report that (and in
which way) you altered the original dataset for your purposes. Also, we
recommend that the final dataset is systematically linked to the
article/report (e.g. as a supplementary material, where all new or
corrected data are highlighted).

## How do you proceed when additional cost(s) or data correction are sent to <updates@invacost.fr>?

Any cost information received needs to be double-checked, standardized
and validated by our team before being integrated in the official
database. This process may take some time, and we add new cost
information in the public (online) database only in the frame of
official updates – in the meantime, we compile and progressively
integrate (offline) all these new cost data.

# **Descriptor “Cost\_ID”**

## Could you explain me how I should assign an ID to a new cost entry I propose to be integrated in the InvaCost database?

Actually, we manage this descriptor internally, and assign new cost IDs
when the database is publically updated.

# **Descriptors “Availability/Previous\_materials”**

## Question on source literature

Question: In some cases, I am not sure if the paper is a mismatch or a
proper paper for the database. For example, in one paper they mention
only in passing, for example in the Introduction or Discussion, some IAS
cost, but they are citing another publication which I cannot access,
e.g.: “Removal of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) in Wenzhou city
cost 128 million US USD in 1996 (Ding and Xie 1996). An estimate for the
economic loss caused by Mikania micrantha on Neilingding Island ranges
from 0.56 to 1.26 million US USD (Zhong et al. 2004).” These cited
publications seem to be in Chinese, so I cannot access the original
material, and the reported information in the accessed is very scarce,
so I would not be able to get all the information we need (e.g. time
scale, spatial coverage, etc. - for the paper in question I think there
will be no data for 90% of types of information we need, simply because
they just briefly cited other papers in two short sentences). What
should I do in such cases, include this paper and the brief information
they report in those sentences, or exclude it from the dataset?

Answer: We opted for the following strategy. First, we include the
papers *Ding and Xie 1996* and *Zhong et al. 2004* \* as main sources
(for which we give the dedicated title, publication year, authors,
etc.), then indicated *no* in the **Availability** column; we mention
the reference from which the unreachable papers came in the
**Previous\_materials** column. Second, the associated information
(geographical situation, time range, etc.) are captured from the
accessible source citing the original reference from where the cost
comes. We encourage you to add any necessary information in the
**Details** column; for instance, you can mention *this estimate comes
from an inaccessible reference*).

## Question on literature availability

Question: I am not completely sure about the **Availability** column, to
which publication it is referred (e.g. see the issue I described in the
previous point). If a paper A cites paper B regarding some cost, and
paper A is available through online access but paper B is not, I was
still noting that as “Freely accessible”, that the paper I describe in
the entry is freely available (even though the cited one is not). This
is a bit confusing I guess, since in such situations we have two papers,
citing and the cited one, so it is question which one are we defining
here?

Answer: It refers to the cited one. If paper B is not accessible, we
mentioned **Reference title**, **Authors** and **Publication year**
associated with paper B, then put *No* in the **Availability** column
(and the full citation of paper A in the **Previous\_materials**
descriptor). We also indicate the full sentence (from paper A) in which
paper B was mentioned in the **Details** column.

# **Descriptors “Environment/ Environment\_IAS”**

## Question on how the impacted environment is reported in the database

Question: If an article proclaims a loss in property values per house on
a lake side, but does not tell us how many houses there actually are nor
tells us if this is for one year or a loss over a certain period of
time, where is the affected environment, terrestrial as it is a house AT
the lake, or is it aquatic as the invader is an aquatic plant that
causes the cost?

Answer: You can add both information, as we have specific columns for
(i) the environment impacted by the cost (**Environment** descriptor)
and (ii) the environment of the concerned invasive alien species
(**Environment\_IAS** descriptor).

# **Descriptor “Official\_country”**

## How to manage entries with multiple countries?

Question: What should we consider information like
“Colombia/Ecuador/Peru” in the ‘Official\_country’ column when analysing
cost data? Could we divide or replicate the cost for each of the three
countries separately?

Answer: This is not realistic to replicate the same cost data for each
country when such cost was provided at a *regional* (and not a
*country*) scale. One could suggest dividing the total cost by the
number of countries, and then replicate the resulting cost estimate for
each of the country. However, it would be highly speculative given we
have no precise idea on how the cost is specifically distributed
(probably not equally) between these countries.

# **Descriptor “Spatial\_scale”**

## Question on how spatial scales are entered in the database

If an article proclaims a loss in property values per house on a lake
side, but does not tell us how many houses there actually are, how
should I deal with it?

You must record the information as it is provided, i.e. take the cost as
given by the authors (no necessary to multiply by the number of houses),
and precise *unit (house)* in the **Spatial scale** column.

## 

Question: How do we treat costs that are given at a per individual level
and/or are estimated as a total savings due to some effective control
measure – e.g. “Reduced respiratory ailments costing approximately
USD23.85 per sufferer induced by the weed per annum. With a reduction of
approximately 350,000 people suffering from hay-fever as a result of
biocontrol in 2005, this equates to an estimated health benefit of
approximately USD8.4M in 2004/05 dollar terms” and another example
“Biocontrol is estimated to reduce production losses in Victoria by
approximately USD4.4M per annum through the following channels…”?

Answer: For the first case (i.e. costs that are given per individual
level), we opted to create a dedicated category in the **Spatial scale**
column, that is *unit’ followed by the indication of the unit in which
the cost was expressed (in brackets). In your case, it would be *unit
(sufferer)*. For the second case (i.e. costs that are estimated as a
total savings due to some effective control measure), we considered them
as such by assigning them to *avoided costs\* in the **Type of cost**
column and *potential* in the **Implementation** column. Indeed, these
costs have not been suffered by people, but should have been if there
was not effective control.

# **Descriptor “Period\_of\_estimation”**

## *14. If an article proclaims an economic loss, but does not tell us if this is for one year or a loss over a certain period of time, how should I deal with it?*

You should indicate *unspecified* in the **period of estimation**
column, and also in the **Time range**, **starting year** and **ending
year** columns (if these information are also not provided).

# **Descriptor “Time\_range”**

## *15. I have costs that are X US USD in total inferred from the last 10 years prior to the publishing year of that study, I can enter the ‘probable starting year’ and ‘probable ending year’, the ‘raw cost estimate’, but I have some doubt for the ‘Time\_range’ descriptor. Could you provide me with some guidance?*

You should consider *year* if the cost is provided as an annual value
expected to occur each year over the last 10 years. Conversely, you
should enter *period* if the cost is provided as a total sum over the 10
years.

# **Descriptors “Probable\_starting\_year / Probable\_ending\_year”**

## *16. What is the difference between these descriptors and those that have ‘adjusted’ as an additional term?*

The **probable\_starting\_year** & **probable\_ending\_year** columns
(named *original columns* hereafter) contain the information extracted
from the processed sources, with the possibility to have no clear
information retrieved. This explains why we have *unspecified* in some
cases. The **probable\_starting\_year\_adjusted** &
**probable\_ending\_year\_adjusted** columns are those we created for
analyses purposes. These columns have the same info than the *original
columns*, except in cases where we have *unspecified* as provided
information. We then filled (only when possible) these cells with an
actual year based on educated guesses (e.g. corresponding to publication
year or calculated from the duration time, when provided).

# **Descriptors “Probable\_starting\_year\_adjusted / Probable\_ending\_year\_adjusted”**

## *17. Why do some cost entries have no information in these columns?*

When we were not able to estimate them based on the ones provided by the
authors (e.g. **Period\_of\_estimation** column), we leave them blank,
and then we don’t calculate the cost estimates per year. This means that
the cost entries that have no information for at least one of these
columns are not included in most of the cost analyses implemented in the
package.

## *18. Could I fill these cells when there is no information, so that the ‘invacost’ package will consider these data for temporal analyses?*

As for any missing information in the database, you can fill the blank
cells based on your own assumptions. In that case, you should upload the
altered dataset and not use the original one if you want to use the
‘invacost’ package – as the latter only includes the original updated
versions of the database.

# **Descriptor “Occurrence”**

## *19. I have costs that are X US USD in total inferred from the last 10 years prior to the publishing year of that study, I can enter the ‘probable starting year’ and ‘probable ending year’, the ‘raw cost estimate’, but I have some doubt for the ‘Time\_range’ descriptor. Could you provide me with some guidance?*

If the cost is expected to not still occurring after these 10 years, you
can indicate *one time* in the **Occurrence** column. Otherwise, you
should put *potentially ongoing*, if there is some reason to suspect
that this cost still continued after its report in the source document.

# **Descriptor “Raw\_cost\_estimate\_local\_currency”**

## *20. How do I report cost estimates in cases when there were both pooled data and data per species provided?*

You should report data per species, but in cases when all data were
reported per same species or group or species, but they provided both
pooled and very detailed data for different cost categories (e.g. price
per gas, manpower, overheads, etc.), you should opt for pooled data. In
some cases, they reported different values for costs for different
years, even though all the other descriptors (species, locality) were
the same. In that case, you should report each of the values separately
for each year.

## *21. One paper I am adding has avoided costs for two scenarios (depending on climate change and management effort): “Under moderate climate change (+1.5 8C by 2050) discounted net benefits (4% discount rate) for the whole period range from 19 to 582 million euros depending on the effectiveness of the policy impact. With stronger climate change (+2.4 8C by 2050) the total discounted savings over the full period are expected to range from 42 to 1063 million euros assuming a highly effective policy.” Which values should I add? (1) pick one scenario (2) add both scenarios as a separate entry (3) average the costs somehow?*

When there are several cost figures from the different scenarios, we
suggest taking the smallest cost (here, 19 million €) as the minimum
cost estimate and the higher cost (here, 1063 million €) as the maximum
cost estimate. From there, you can use the median cost (of all the known
values) as the **Raw cost estimate**.

# **Descriptor “Raw\_cost\_estimate\_2017 (USD\_exchange\_rate or USD\_PPP)”**

## *22. How should we convert the collected costs to 2017 US USD?*

We ask collectors to record only the raw cost estimate as provided in
the source document. The cost standardisation to 2017 US USD is carried
out by us. We are working on implementing this step directly into the
‘invacost’ package.

## *23. I have a list of direct costs and a single “total cost” for each species, where the total cost includes both direct and indirect costs. I think about adding all of them as separate lines in the database (with direct costs separated by sector where possible), but technically that’s repeating some of the costs - what would you suggest?*

As you do not a comprehensive list for the indirect costs (as is the
case for direct costs here), I suggest to collate only total costs per
species – so that you will not miss the estimates associated with
indirect costs (it would be the case if you opt for adding direct costs
only. If you feel some costs may be repeated, you can specify this
information in the **Overlap** column. Also, you can provide a full
explanation of your choice in the ‘Details’ descriptor, so that readers
and users will be aware that complementary details can be found in the
source document.

# **Descriptor “Cost\_estimate\_per\_year\_2017 (USD\_exchange\_rate or USD\_PPP)”**

## *24. Why do some cells not contain cost values?*

There are cost entries for which we have inadequate time period
information: some studies omitted to provide time periods, which can
cause tremendous biases when analyzing the temporal trends of costs.
Sometimes, this is not problematic as we can safely guess when costs
occurred. In other cases, the exact or approximate duration of costs
that spread over several years/decades is hardly guessable; therefore,
it was impossible to safely estimate cost estimates per years for the
latter cost entries.

# **Descriptor “Type\_of\_applicable\_year”**

## *25. If there is no way to infer the type of applicable year, what do I put in that column?*

Actually, the applicable year is the year used for standardizing costs
to US USD 2017. You must fill the cell with either *effective* if the
authors specified the info in their paper, or *publication year*
otherwise. Therefore, you should use the publication year of the source
in your case.

# **Descriptor “Implementation”**

## *26. I sometimes struggle to distinguish between “observed” versus “potential” costs. For example, I read the following “We estimate hogweed prevalence at circa 0.1 hectare per district. Given 323 rural districts, yields an expectation of 0.323 km2 inhabited by hogweed, whose removal would cost over € 5.6 million. However, these control efforts are not being undertaken, it must be further assumed that less than 10 % of this infested area is being dealt with (author’s estimate).” Then later in the text these € 5.6 million listed as “annual costs incurred by giant hogweed infestation in Germany.” The authors classify it as an incurred –&gt; observed cost, despite previously mentioning that only 10% of this estimated amount is actually being spent. I have classified it as “potential” although I still have doubts because the estimate is based on the species’ current distribution. What do you say?*

We agree with the choice you did, i.e. classify this cost as *potential*
because the control efforts were not undertaken. Note that we are
currently refining this descriptor in order to consider simultaneously
the distribution of the invasive species, the nature (realized or not)
of the cost as well as the temporality (past/current or predicted) of
the quantified impact in the study area.

# **Descriptor “Acquisition\_method”**

## *27. You mention that “extrapolation” relies on computational modeling. Is it always the case? For example, if it’s a simple area-based upscaling without any modeling involved, would it be estimation or extrapolation?*

It is likely that a large part of reported/estimated costs comes from
spatial up-scaling (for instance, costs reported at a *national* scale
are probably not systematically the result of estimations from all the
regions of the country, but often derive from estimations made for a one
or some areas within this country). However, in most cases the authors
do not explicitly state it. Therefore, we have decided to indicate
*extrapolation* only when it is clearly indicated in the paper (for
instance, via formula or calculations over a long time period or area).

# **Descriptor “Impacted\_sector”**

## *28. Where the costs are for eradication, what is the appropriate “impacted sector”? Is it the sector where most of the costs of the invader would be if it weren’t eradicated, or should it be authority/stakeholder costs because they are the ones paying for the eradication?*

In cases where we don’t have exact information on the sector(s) impacted
by the cost, we put *Diverse/unspecified* when the costs are explicitly
related to damage or loss. When this is about management – like in your
case – we enter *authority/stakeholders*.

# **Descriptor “Type\_of\_cost”**

## *29. The paper on economic impact of Acacia in Israel actually reports the annual mean willingness to pay (WTP) for containment or eradication of A. saligna was US USD8.41 and US USD8.83, respectively. This is a non-monetary method. So I guess we should not include it in Invacost?*

Actually, we report all economic estimates irrespective of the method
used. Especially, the WTP is a method that was used for several cost
estimates already recorded in our database. You can therefore enter this
*containment/eradication* cost and indicate that the method used is the
mean willingness to pay in the **Details** column.

## *30. In some papers, they report that control/eradication investment contributed to certain economic value that was saved (e.g. ecosystem services, agriculture production, etc.) - something that would be destroyed by IAS if such control effort was not implemented (e.g. “It has been estimated that if sea lamprey was not controlled, the loss of fishing opportunities and indirect economic impacts could be greater than USD500 million annually”). I was also including such costs as “Extrapolation”/“Potential” costs - on one hand, that is something that did not happen and won’t it happen, because there was control effort and such loss was prevented, but on the other hand that is a nice indication of the potential of IAS to cause economic cost, so it seemed appropriate to enter such economic benefits saved/prevented through control as estimates of potential damage some species can produce. What do you think?*

We agree with you. In addition, these potential cost estimates should be
considered as *avoided costs* for the **Type\_of\_cost** descriptor.

## *31. I have two papers which report avoided damage costs using cost-benefit analyses. I interpret these as benefit values, and if I understand correctly we do not include those in Invacost? I have included excerpts from the paper here below. What is your advice?*

These costs should not be considered as actual benefits because they are
not the results of the direct exploitation of the invasive species. We
decided to consider them as *avoided costs* (for the **Type of cost**),
and mark them as *potential* costs (for the **Implementation**
descriptor). Indeed, they represent money would have been lost if
nothing was done.

# **Descriptor “Method\_reliability”**

## *32. Should I consider only cost data considered as of “high” reliability?*

You should remember that this column does not reflect a systematic
examination of the methodology for peer-reviewed articles and official
reports (we did it only for grey materials that were likely not assessed
by pairs or experts), but rather reflects an objective categorisation
based on transparent and consistent criteria. This strategy was used
because assessing the reliability of very diverse methods used on
various taxonomic groups, habitats and economic sectors of hundreds of
studies simply makes any objective dichotomy between *high* and *low*
reliability highly challenging. Therefore, this descriptor should be
considered as a first approximation of cost reliability, and you should
decide whether or not you want to eliminate papers on this basis. To do
that, take time to investigate the **Details** descriptor (especially
for cost values that you deem suspiciously high) and potentially go back
to the original source document to make your decision. For an example on
how to do that, take a look at the “Determining cost estimate
reproducibility” section in Bradshaw et al. 2016:
<https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms12986>). You could also rely on the
**Method\_reliability\_refined** descriptor (see below).

## *33. I am not sure if the criteria I was applying for this column is a proper one. If the authors of a grey report did some estimation/calculation/extrapolation themselves, or cited others who did it, but in either case if they did not explain clearly how they came up with the value (in a clear enough manner so others could repeat the whole procedure) I was marking it as “Low”, as being a non-repeatable value. Moreover, if they reported some investment (e.g. cost of eradication in some area) but didn’t provide clear data about it (e.g. who funded it, who and what was exactly funded, etc.), e.g. if they only cited briefly some other paper as a source, I was also marking it as “Low”, as being non-repeatable - I am not sure if this is OK?*

Yes, we agree with your choices as the estimation methodology for grey
materials (other than official reports) should be transparent and
reproducible to be considered as of *high* reliability.

# **Descriptor “Method\_reliability\_refined”**

## *34. What is the difference between the ‘Method\_reliability’ and the ‘Method\_reliability\_refined’columns?*

The reproducibility of published methods should not rely only on the
nature of the materials, but also on the transparency and
reproducibility of the methodology *per se*. The individual examination
of the methods employed by the thousands of document sources analysed
when building InvaCost came with a series of constrains and limitations,
which are generally associated with too large datasets involving several
collaborators (see question \#33). Indeed, the attribution of
reproducibility should be a qualitative procedure specific to each
monetary estimate recorded, which requires specific expertise and time.
The regular updates of the database as well as the growing scientific
community working on the InvaCost project allows now to carry out such a
tremendous work. This **Method\_reliability\_refined** descriptor relies
on an expert-based assessment of reliability – and not pre-defined
criteria – and can be used as an alternative or as a complementary
approach to the standard \*\*Method\_reliability\* descriptor.

## *35. Why do some cost entries have empty cells for this descriptor?*

We fill this column as we get new expert-based assessment of the method
reliability of the cost entries. This means that currently empty cells
will be filled as the database is updated.

# **Descriptor “Overlap”**

## *36. There are some studies which have modelled the cost of managing (or containing) invasive species in a landscape. Like other modelling studies, these studies often use known parameters based on a small spatial scale to extrapolate the estimated cost for a larger spatio-temporal scale. While dealing with these studies, should we extract both information or only the extrapolated one?*

Yes, we should extract both cost data, which will allow opting for one
or the other information depending on the analyses targeted and the
research questions. However, you should indicate that both costs are
overlapping in the **Overlap** descriptor.

# **Descriptor “Benefit\_value(s)”**

## *37. My understanding is that this should be noted with “Yes” only if the authors also reported that the given IAS also produces some positive monetary values, and they reported such values in the paper? There is also a case where authors report cost of controlling/eradicating some species, and they also provide some positive values that such control efforts produce (e.g. increased employment), but I think this should not be considered as a benefit value of IAS, as it is not a monetary gain IAS produces, right?*

Yes, we consider **Benefit\_values** as existing from the analysed
sources only when money was gained from direct exploitation of the
invasive alien species (IAS) studied. In the second case you explained,
we considered *avoiding costs* for those apparent benefit-like values,
i.e. money that is not loss any more due to efficient management
strategy targeting the involved IAS. For instance, if a species A
(impacting agriculture) was successfully controlled (control costs =
10,000 USD) and that the net benefit is 13,000 USD, we use one line for
control costs (= 10,000 USD) and another for avoiding costs (= 13,000
USD). Alternatively, if this species A is used for trade activities that
generates 14,000 USD, we simply mentioned *yes* in the
**Benefit\_values** column , but only if the source also contains (at
least) one cost estimate – which is the first requirement to have this
source recorded in the database.
